# hcsrs
Rust wrapper of Host Compute Service API

## Overview

This project is a collection of Rust libraries that wrap functionality exposed by the [Host Compute Service](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2017/01/27/introducing-the-host-compute-service-hcs/).

HCS (Host Compute Service for short) APIs are part of the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk).

Public documentation for the HCS is yet to be released.

## Requirements

For this wrapper to build properly, the following requirements need to be met by the building machine:

- **Windows 10 SDK version 10.0.17763.132**.
